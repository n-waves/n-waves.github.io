We are proud to announce that our team won the first prize in Language
Model Category in PolEval 2018, competition organised by Polish Academy
of Science. 

PolEval is the most relevant Natural Language Processing competition
dedicated to polish language. 

Language modeling is a stepping stone for the more pragmatic
applications like suggesting responses to the text massages, sentyment
analysis (whether a comment in internet forum is positive, neutral or
negative), documents categorisation, text summarisation etc.

Our solution is based on state of the art model published by Jeremy
Howard and Sebastian Ruder in Feb 2018
([link](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)).

We'll have the chance to present our 1st award-winning solution at the
NLP Day organised by the creators of PolEval this autumn. Hope you will
join us at the event!
