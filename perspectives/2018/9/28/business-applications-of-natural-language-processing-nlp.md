Is it possible for a computer to understand text or speech as humans do?
And then translate it into another language?

History of **natural language processing (NLP)** goes back to the 1950s
when the first trials of fully automatic translation from Russian into
English took place. And it failed pitifully. Machines of that time could
not cope with the interpretation of the context of what the infamous
example was the biblical \"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak"
translated as "vodka is good, but the meat is rotten". But despite its
difficult beginnings NLP is fine and is useful in business. Here are
some examples that we think you might find handy.

Sentiment Analysis {#sentiment-analysis style="white-space: pre-wrap;"}
------------------

*Area of application*: *Customer service (performance monitoring),
Marketing (brand monitoring)*

It's not a secret that companies actively monitor their online presence.
As consumers talk about brands and companies through social media
platforms, and often submit their complaints there - Twitter, Snapchat,
Instagram, Facebook monitoring has become a great opportunity and
challenge for companies.

Sentiment analysis which detects the emotional state and the attitude of
the writer can be a helpful tool for them. It's achieved by either
assigning a polarity to the text (neutral, positive or negative) or
detecting the mood (sad, happy, angry, etc). In the case when ambivalent
or multiple attitudes appear in the same sentence, the text may be split
into clauses and polarity and mood are assigned to each one separately.
For example "This restaurant is nice, but the staff is rude."

Even though we can get quite a high accuracy on sentiment analysis on
specific sets of texts it is not possible yet to build a universal
sentiment detector. To obtain high accuracy it is best to train models
on your own annotated data. Fortunately, this step can be quickly
achieved with either Amazon Mechanical Truck or even better by your team
using tools like [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/features/) that
significantly speeds up the process by showing you only the examples
were your sentiment model is the least sure about. This area of NLP
received quite a performance boost in early 2018 when the researchers
found out how to use transfer learning. We will devote another article
to give you more details and briefly discuss the performance of
sentiment models in different European languages.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) {#named-entity-recognition-ner style="white-space: pre-wrap;"}
------------------------------

*Area of application: brand monitoring, customer satisfaction research,
journalism, finances*

As we already know companies need to go far beyond their internal data
to have their fingers on the pulse. Online text source like social media
posts, forums, public reports, blogs, online newspapers and many others
contain plenty of information which extracted and ordered, can give
valuable insight on you and your competition. It is where NER can be
useful. NER annotates text marking occurrences of named entities (a term
coined by researchers to refer to names of persons, organisations,
locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values,
percentages, etc.).

For example the following text:

         “n-waves won the first price in PolEval 2018.”

would be annotated as follows:

         “[n-waves]ORG won the [first price]AWARD in [PolEval]ORG [2018]TIME.”

And the following information could get extracted:

This step dramatically simplifies downstream task like content
categorisation and tagging, text summarisation, it helps as well search
engines to become more accurate.

We see this technique being used in customer support and brand
monitoring as a first task to categorise gigabytes of customer feedback
and associate it with a product and/or a company it refers to. This
information later can be used to automatically classify user messages or
apply sentiment analysis to obtain practical scores about the companies
and their competition.

Unfortunately, as most of the Natural Language Processing tasks, NER is
quite brittle, which means that a highly accurate model trained on one
particular stream of data like Twitter won\'t work that well with texts
from a different domain like news articles or customer forums. So to
achieve highly accurate models the best is to use your own data.
Fortunately, as in the case of sentiment analysis, the same tools can
help you quickly add relevant text annotations.

Text summarisation {#text-summarisation style="white-space: pre-wrap;"}

Long documents shortened to the elegant and concise abstract. Thanks to
NLP you don't need to lie over the volumes of files. There are two
approaches to this task -- extraction and abstraction. An
extraction-based approach will find the most important parts of the
text, (sentences or the whole paragraphs) and build the summary out of
them. An abstraction-based approach goes even further. The computer
doesn't merely copy the significant parts but writes the brief in its
own words, just like a human would do. This approach is still under
active research though, and however close we are, today extraction
approach is the one in daily use.

There are several real-world application for this technique. The obvious
one is google and other search engines. You see the text summarisation
in every result page. But there are more subtle applications. Imagine
how with text summarisation the doctor can quickly get a summary of a
medical profile of each of his numerous patients based on their medical
check-ups and test results. Or how it can help lawyers to go through
ever-changing law regulations to extract some relevant rules that
concern their clients.

Fortunately, the text summarisation based on extraction is a mostly
solved problem, and you can apply existing software like ElasticSearch
reasonably quickly. However, if you're looking at some more
sophisticated use case where text generation is required you need quite
a few examples. If you are a sizeable law office, there is a good chance
that you already have the data that is needed at hand, from your past
engagement. In other cases, where you have to generate the training
examples yourself, there are no shortcuts and your best bet is to do it
or employ a company like Amazon Mechanical Truck.

NLP is still young, but promising field. Not everything works yet, but
the development is intensive and with recent advancement in deep
learning, we see vast improvements discovered every month. It will take
a while until computers start to understand the texts on par with
humans. But even though its limitations NLP is a valuable technology
with plenty of useful business applications.
