Since yesterday we have a deep learning model that is able to generate
fairy tales that are consistent and almost completely logical. You could
easily read such stories to your kids and this is terrifying news.

I bet you heard the stories of fake scientific papers generated by the
AI, that were rubbish but they were written using good English but
without a logical train of thoughts, but the text sounded good and
convincing. This kind of text was easy to generate, but this wasn't any
threat as it was easy to spot if the text wasn't using fancy terms as it
was at times illogical and inherent.

If you haven't seen that before the here is an example generated by a
language model trained in 2018 that we trained on \~15% of English
Wikipedia:

> *John Wood , Jr . , president of The National Association for the Re -
> Creation of the World ( NAVY ) and World War ii Victory Director, from
> which he also made a successful article. During the \"Red Scare\", he
> stated that \"You shall be to America\'s free West Side\", and that
> \"\[t\]he French , Russian, , Indian, Canadian, Australian, Japanese,
> German, and Italian alike must be taken seriously. \" Daniel Craig
> said of Smith, \" The Americans are a great deal for a country of our
> own, and are very proud of us .....*

You can see that it is readable English, but it lacks any coherence so
it is easy to spot that it is fake. Here is another example that is a
bit more tricky as it was trained on medical texts:

> *...of bilateral leg veins that was ruled out by inline) it. had at

Given the number of complex words you might be fooled that this
diagnosis is written by a real person.

But what OpenAI presented two days ago is in a completely different
league even though it uses very similar concepts to the models above.
Their model called GPT-2 is using Deep learning, the difference is the
amount of data they trained the models on (8 mln websites) and the
complexity of their architecture. They've used very heavy models called
Transformers. But have a look, yourself. Here is what the model received
as the input that it should use to a news article from (the text was
written by a human):

> *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living
> in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains.
> Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns
> spoke perfect English.*

and here is the story generated by the GPT-2, some of my thoughts below:

*The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn,
Ovid's Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously
unknown to science.*

*Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd
phenomenon is finally solved.*

> *Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La
> Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when
> they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez
> noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain,
> surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.*
>
> *Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. "By the
> time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some
> crystals on top," said Pérez.*
>
> *Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These
> creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much
> to see them --- they were so close they could touch their horns.*
>
> *While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered
> that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez
> stated, "We can see, for example, that they have a common 'language,'
> something like a dialect or dialectic."*
>
> *Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in
> Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost
> race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those
> parts of South America.*
>
> *While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the
> creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a
> time before human civilization. According to Pérez, "In South America,
> such incidents seem to be quite common."*
>
> *However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way
> of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost
> alien race is through DNA. "But they seem to be able to communicate in
> English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at
> least a change in social organization," said the scientist.*

Have you noticed how the model is consistent in using the way he talks
about the discovery of Dr. Jorge Perez. How he started with a full name
and later just used the last name, or how it knew that the Unicorns have
Horns, and how it imagined the interbreeding between humans and unicorns
in the past so that they speak English. It got lost a bit the train of
thoughts, but I haven't noticed when I read the text for the first time.

This blew my mind and terrified me at the same time. Working with this
kind of models I obviously knew that a day is coming when we will have
models that are able to generate news with coherent thoughts. But I
wasn't expecting to see it so soon.

Fortunately, Open AI being an NGO founded by Elon Musk is taking it job
of mitigating the risk of AGI very seriously, and they haven't published
the weights of the full model and knowing how damage it could create.
And if we consider how much such models cost to train (the GPT-1 was
\~17k USD and GPT-2 is just 10x larger trained on 10x more data) we
won\'t see spammers using them any time soon.

But I'm still worried, in what kind of world we are going to live in.

The good news is that the text generation is only one of many ways you
can use this kind of models. You can use them to train question
answering models, to classify text and/or to infer information out of
unstructured data. Hopefully, we can use them to check the sources of
the news articles.

If you want to know more about less terrifying and more useful ways of
using such models [feel free to get in touch with
us. ](https://n-waves.com/contact)We are working adopting such
breakthroughs to business task on all European Languages.
